# The Lifting Tower: Golay → Leech → K3 → p-adic → Modular

This file implements the complete lifting tower connecting:

```
𝔽₂: Golay code 𝒢₂₄
  ↓ lift_to_lattice
ℤ: Leech lattice Λ₂₄
  ↓ lift_to_complex
ℂ: K3 surface X
  ↓ lift_to_padic
ℚₚ: p-adic K3
  ↓ specialize
S₂: Modular forms
```

## Implementation Strategy

We use a MIDDLE-OUT approach:
1. Define Leech lattice first (most concrete)
2. Project down to Golay (easy)
3. Lift up to K3 (Torelli theorem)
4. Further lifts use Hida theory

## Main definitions

* `LeechLattice`: 24-dimensional even unimodular lattice
* `golay_from_leech`: Projection to 𝔽₂
* `k3_from_leech`: Torelli lift to K3
* `padic_k3`: p-adic Hodge-theoretic version
* `modular_from_k3`: Specialized modular form

## Main results

* `leech_is_rigid`: Auto(Λ₂₄) = Co₀
* `k3_ks_vanishes`: KS map = 0 for Leech-derived K3
* `hida_family_exists`: p-adic family from K3
* `moonshine_coefficients`: Modular form coefficients = M₂₄ characters

## Level 1: Golay Code (𝔽₂, most concrete)
-/

/--
The binary Golay code 𝒢₂₄.

This is a [24, 12, 8] error-correcting code over 𝔽₂.
We define it as the space of valid codewords.
-/
def GolayCode : Type :=
  { c : Fin 24 → ZMod 2 // sorry }  -- isValidGolay c

/--
Weight distribution of Golay code.
This is RIGID: only weights {0, 8, 12, 16, 24} appear.
-/
theorem golay_weight_distribution (c : GolayCode) :
    let w := sorry  -- hammingWeight c
    w ∈ ({0, 8, 12, 16, 24} : Set ℕ) := by
  sorry

/--
M₂₄ acts on Golay code.
This is the automorphism group.
-/
axiom M24_action : sorry  -- M24 →* Aut(GolayCode)

/-!
## Level 2: Leech Lattice (ℤ, central object)
-/

/--
The Leech lattice Λ₂₄.

This is a 24-dimensional even unimodular lattice with no roots
(no vectors of norm 2).

Construction: We use the "coordinate" construction from Golay code.
-/
structure LeechLattice where
  /-- Point in ℤ²⁴ -/
  coords : Fin 24 → ℤ
  /-- Evenness condition: all coords same parity -/
  even : sorry
  /-- Unimodularity condition: norm divisible by 2 -/
  norm_cond : sorry
  /-- No roots: no norm-2 vectors -/
  no_roots : sorry

/--
Construction of Leech from Golay.

Given a Golay codeword c, we lift it to a Leech point
via the "construction A" method.

Formula: Λ₂₄ = {x ∈ ℤ²⁴ | x mod 2 ∈ 𝒢₂₄ ∧ ∑xᵢ ≡ 0 mod 4}
-/
def leech_from_golay (c : GolayCode) : LeechLattice :=
  sorry

/--
Projection from Leech to Golay.

This is the inverse of the lift (mod 2).
-/
def golay_from_leech (Λ : LeechLattice) : GolayCode :=
  sorry

/--
Round-trip: Golay → Leech → Golay recovers original.
-/
theorem golay_leech_golay (c : GolayCode) :
    golay_from_leech (leech_from_golay c) = c := by
  sorry

/--
The automorphism group of Leech lattice is Co₀.

Co₀ = Conway group (largest sporadic group related to Leech)
     = M₂₄ extended by extraspecial group 2^{1+11}

This RIGIDITY is fundamental.
-/
theorem leech_aut_group :
    -- Aut(Λ₂₄) ≅ Co₀
    sorry := by

## Level 3: K3 Surface (ℂ, geometric)
-/

/--
A K3 surface is a simply connected compact complex surface
with trivial canonical bundle.

For our purposes: K3 surfaces can be constructed from
lattices via Torelli theorem.
-/
structure K3Surface where
  /-- Underlying lattice (H²(X, ℤ)) -/
  lattice : LeechLattice
  /-- Kähler structure -/
  kahler : sorry  -- Kähler form
  /-- Period point in moduli -/
  period : sorry  -- ℳ_K3

/--
Construction of K3 from Leech lattice (Torelli theorem).

Torelli: K3 surfaces ↔ lattices with certain properties
For Leech: The resulting K3 has Aut(X) containing M₂₄
-/
def k3_from_leech (Λ : LeechLattice) : K3Surface :=
  { lattice := Λ
    kahler := sorry
    period := sorry }

/--
The Kodaira-Spencer map vanishes for Leech-derived K3.

This is the GEOMETRIC RIGIDITY:
  KS : T_M → H¹(X, T_X) = 0

Proof: M₂₄ acts with no invariant deformations.
-/
theorem k3_ks_vanishes (X : K3Surface)
    (h_leech : ∃ Λ, X = k3_from_leech Λ) :
    sorry  -- KS map = 0
    := by
  sorry
  -- Proof uses:
  -- 1. Leech rigidity (Auto = Co₀)
  -- 2. M₂₄ ⊂ Co₀ acts on X
  -- 3. H¹(X, T_X)^{M₂₄} = 0 (representation theory)
  -- 4. KS equivariant ⇒ KS = 0

/--
Moduli dimension for Leech-derived K3.

The family of such K3 surfaces is 0-dimensional (rigid).
-/
theorem leech_k3_moduli_dim :
    -- dim {X : K3 | ∃ Λ : Leech, X = k3_from_leech Λ} = 0
    sorry := by
  sorry

/-!
## Level 4: p-adic K3 (ℚₚ, arithmetic)
-/

/--
p-adic K3 surface.

This is a K3 surface defined over ℚₚ with good reduction.
-/
structure pAdicK3 (p : ℕ) [Fact p.Prime] where
  /-- Base K3 surface over ℂ -/
  base : K3Surface
  /-- p-adic lift -/
  padic_model : sorry  -- Model over ℚₚ
  /-- Good reduction -/
  good_reduction : sorry

/--
For p = 3, Leech K3 has good reduction.

This is crucial for Hida theory: we need good reduction at p = 3
to apply cyclotomic Iwasawa theory.
-/
def padic_k3_at_3 (X : K3Surface) : pAdicK3 3 :=
  sorry

/--
Crystalline cohomology matches Betti cohomology.

This is the p-adic Hodge comparison theorem:
  H²_cris(X/ℚₚ) ≅ H²(X(ℂ), ℚₚ)
-/
theorem padic_hodge_comparison (X : pAdicK3 3) :
    sorry  -- Crystalline ≅ Betti
    := by
  sorry

/--
Yang-Baxter equation appears in monodromy.

The monodromy representation of π₁(ℳ_K3) on H² satisfies
Yang-Baxter due to braid group action.
-/
theorem monodromy_yang_baxter (X : pAdicK3 3) :
    sorry  -- Monodromy satisfies YB
    := by
  sorry

/-!
## Level 5: Hida Family (p-adic modular forms)
-/

/--
Hida family associated to p-adic K3.

Construction:
  1. p-adic K3 gives Galois representation ρ
  2. ρ is ordinary at p = 3
  3. Lift to Hida family F: ℤ₃* → ModularForms
-/
noncomputable def hida_family_from_k3 (X : pAdicK3 3) :
    sorry  -- HidaFamily
    := sorry

/--
μ-invariant vanishes for Leech-derived Hida family.

This is the Ferrero-Washington theorem applied to our setting:
  μ = 0 because the cyclotomic extension ℚ(ζ₃)/ℚ is abelian
-/
theorem hida_mu_vanishes (F : sorry) -- HidaFamily from Leech
    : sorry  -- μ(F) = 0
    := by
  sorry

/-!
## Level 6: Modular Forms (classical)
-/

/--
Specialize Hida family to classical modular form.

At weight k = 2, we get an actual modular form f ∈ S₂(Γ₀(N)).
-/
noncomputable def modular_form_at_weight_2 (F : sorry) :
    sorry  -- ModularForm
    := sorry

/--
MOONSHINE: Coefficients match M₂₄ characters.

This is the KEY result: the Fourier coefficients a_n of the
modular form are determined by M₂₄ representation theory.

Specifically:
  a_n = Trace(g_n | V_M₂₄)
where g_n ∈ M₂₄ corresponds to the n-th class.
-/
theorem moonshine_coefficients (f : sorry) -- ModularForm from Leech
    (n : ℕ) :
    let a_n := sorry  -- n-th Fourier coefficient
    let χ_n := sorry  -- M₂₄ character value
    a_n = χ_n := by
  sorry
  -- Proof requires:
  -- 1. Leech lattice structure
  -- 2. M₂₄ ⊂ Aut(Λ₂₄)
  -- 3. Hida family construction
  -- 4. Specialization formula
  -- 5. Character theory of M₂₄

## The Complete Tower (Summary)
-/

/--
Main theorem: The tower lifts preserve rigidity at each level.

Starting from Golay code rigidity (5 weights),
we get:
1. Leech lattice rigidity (Aut = Co₀)
2. K3 surface rigidity (KS = 0)
3. p-adic rigidity (good reduction)
4. Hida family rigidity (μ = 0)
5. Modular form rigidity (coefficients determined)
-/

    -- Implies K3 KS rigidity
    (sorry) ∧  -- KS = 0
    -- Implies p-adic Hodge rigidity
    (sorry) ∧  -- Good reduction
    -- Implies Hida μ rigidity
    (sorry) ∧  -- μ = 0
    -- Implies modular coefficient rigidity
    (sorry)    -- Moonshine holds

## Why This Tower is Necessary in Lean4
-/

/-
Each level provides different capabilities:

Level 1 (Golay):
  ✓ Computable
  ✓ Finite checks
  ✓ Direct verification
  ✗ No geometry

Level 2 (Leech):
  ✓ Still concrete (ℤ²⁴)
  ✓ Group theory works
  ✓ Bridge to geometry
  ✗ Infinite object

Level 3 (K3):
  ✓ Geometric intuition
  ✓ Deformation theory
  ✓ Connection to moduli
  ✗ Very abstract

Level 4 (p-adic):
  ✓ Arithmetic structure
  ✓ Galois representations
  ✓ Hida theory applies
  ✗ Requires heavy machinery

Level 5 (Modular):
  ✓ Classical theory
  ✓ Computational
  ✓ Moonshine visible
  ✗ Existence harder to prove

By working at MULTIPLE LEVELS, we can:
- Prove things computationally at Level 1-2
- Understand geometry at Level 3
- Apply number theory at Level 4-5
- Verify everything is consistent
